# Mindwave Unity - Known issues

If the connection to the headset can't be established or is often lost:

* 1) Turn off, and then turn on the headset, wait some seconds and retry
* 2) Check if the headset appears in the Bluetooth devices. If not, change the battery and retry
* 3) Quit ThinkGear Connector (totally, a process could still be running), then reopen it, and retry
* 4) Still not working ? Mh, things become complicated. May you should restart your computer (in doubt...)
* 5) ... I'm sorry for you :/
